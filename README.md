# Chicago-Socioeconomic-and-Crime-Analysis-using-SQL

The city of Chicago released a dataset of socioeconomic data to the Chicago City Portal. This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012.
Scores on the hardship index can range from 1 to 100, with a higher index number representing a greater level of hardship.
A detailed description of the dataset can be found on the [city of Chicago's website](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2)

The city of Chicago also released a dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days.
